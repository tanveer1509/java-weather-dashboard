Description:
This app lets users check the current weather for any city. It connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to get real-time data like temperature, wind, and humidity. It also has a GUI built with Java Swing.

How it works:
- The user enters a city name and picks a unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
- The app sends a request to the API.
- It parses the JSON response to find the weather details.
- The background color changes depending on if it is day or night.
- It saves a list of recent searches in the history box.

How to Run:
1. Make sure you have an internet connection.
2. Open WeatherApp.java.
3. Run the file as a Java Application.
4. Type a city name (e.g., "Dhaka") and click the button.
